ConvertFlow is a high-performance, privacy-focused web application that converts images to PDF entirely within your browser. No files are ever uploaded to a server.

## 🚀 Features

- **100% Client-Side**: Powered by WebAssembly and Web Workers. Your data never leaves your device.
- **Ultra-Modern UI**: Glassmorphism aesthetic, Bento-grid layout, and framer-motion animations.
- **Ironclad Performance**: 
  - **Multi-Threaded**: Images are processed in parallel using a pool of Workers.
  - **GPU Accelerated**: Image rendering uses `OffscreenCanvas` and `createImageBitmap` for blazing speed.
  - **Memory Efficient**: Zero-copy transfer with `ArrayBuffer` and rigorous blob cleanup.
- **Mobile First**:
  - **Thumb-Zone Action Bar**: Critical controls within easy reach.
  - **Touch Sensors**: Smart drag-and-drop that respects scrolling.
  - **Responsive**: Adapts from mobile dual-grid to desktop power-station.
- **Format Support**: JPG, PNG, and HEIC (Apple Photos).
